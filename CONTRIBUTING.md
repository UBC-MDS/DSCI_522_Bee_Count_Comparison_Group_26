# Contributing to the Bee Counts Comparison Project

This outlines how to propose a change to the Bee Counts Comparison project. 

### Fixing typos

Small typos or grammatical errors in documentation may be edited directly using
the GitHub web interface, so long as the changes are made in the _source_ file.


### Prerequisites

Before you make a substantial pull request, you should always check if there is any possible conflict and make sure someone from the team agrees that it's a problem. If you've found a bug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug with a minimal 
[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).

### Pull request process

*  We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).  
*  New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org) or PEP8 [style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
